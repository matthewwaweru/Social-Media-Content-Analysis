# Social-Media-Content-Analysis

## Project Overview
The project involves conducting comprehensive Data Visualization and Analysis to gain insights into Social Buzz's content trends and user engagement. This will include analyzing sample data sets and creating visualizations to highlight key patterns in user reactions and behaviors.

A critical aspect of the analysis will be identifying the Top 5 Content Categories based on aggregate user interactions and popularity. By evaluating content engagement, we will be able to provide actionable insights to guide Social Buzz in optimizing their platform and enhancing user experience.
